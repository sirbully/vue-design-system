**Challenge:** Create a reusable input with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other `design system` challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Don’t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

> - User story: I can see error state
> - User story: I can choose to disable input
> - User story: I can choose to have helper text
> - User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
> - User story: I can have different input sizes
> - User story: I can have different colors
> - User story: I can choose to have input take the width of the parent
> - User story: I can have multiline input like a `textarea`
> - User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
> - User story: I can still access all input attributes
> - User story (optional): Show input in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the input in multiple states is enough
